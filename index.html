                <h2>Animorphs Vol 1: Download Story</h2>
                <p class="story-preview"> My name is Jake. That's my first name, obviously. I can't tell you my last name. It would be too
                    dangerous. The Controllers are everywhere. Everywhere. And if they knew my full name, they could
                    find me and my friends, and then . . . well, let's just say I don't want them to find me. What they do to
                    people who resist them is too horrible to think about.<br>
                    I won't even tell you where I live. You'll just have to trust me that it is a real place, a real town.
                    It may even be your town.<br>
                    I'm writing this all down so that more people will learn the truth. Maybe then, somehow, the
                    human race can survive until the Andalites return and rescue us, as they promised they would.<br>
                    Maybe.</p>

                <p class="story-preview">My name is Rachel. I won’t tell you my last name. None of us will ever tell you our last names.
                    Whenever I do use a last name, it’s a fake. Sorry, but that’s the way it has to be. And we won’t tell
                    you the name of our town, or our school, or even what state we are in. If I told you my last name, the
                    Yeerks would be able to find my friends and me. And if they ever find us, it will be the end.<br>
                    They might kill us. Or worse.<br>
                    Yes, there really is something worse than death.</p>
